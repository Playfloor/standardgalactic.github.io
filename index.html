                    Here is another "Why FORTH?" essay: http://www.jwdt.com/~paysan/why-forth.html

                      Discussion and criticism of this FORTH here: http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2452

                        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                          This code draws heavily on the design of LINA FORTH (http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/lina.html)
                            by Albert van der Horst.  Any similarities in the code are probably not accidental.

                              Some parts of this FORTH are also based on this IOCCC entry from 1992:
                                http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/IOCCC/1992/buzzard.2.design.
                                  I was very proud when Sean Barrett, the original author of the IOCCC entry, commented in the LtU thread
                                    http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2452#comment-36818 about this FORTH.

                                      And finally I'd like to acknowledge the (possibly forgotten?) authors of ARTIC FORTH because their
                                        original program which I still have on original cassette tape kept nagging away at me all these years.
