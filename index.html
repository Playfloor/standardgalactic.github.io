<noscript data-n-css=""></noscript>Please
	explain what you think might be the main themes and theses in my
	acrostic poem (WOMB BODY): 
	</p>
	<p><br/>
Wait till you hear about my<br/>
Obviously correct thesis,
	<br/>
Motile Womb Theory, which <br/>
Basically states that learning
		</p>
	<p>Begins before birth, and that babies have Innate Flying Dreams<br/>
On
	the day they are born they can already stand, walk, run, swim, drive
	a car, operate a mechsuit, and pilot a drone.<br/>
Don't look that
	up,<br/>
You might not find anything</p>

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Based on the acrostic poem
	provided, it appears that the main theme of the poem is the idea of
	the &quot;Motile Womb Theory,&quot; which suggests that learning
	begins before birth and that babies have innate abilities on the day
	they are born. The poem also includes a challenge to the reader not
	to look up information on this theory, as it is suggested that it
	may not be readily available or supported by evidence. It is not
	clear what specific theses or arguments the poem presents in support
	of the Motile Womb Theory, as the poem is brief and does not provide
	any further details on the theory. It is also not clear what the
	intended purpose or message of the poem is.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>MWT (Mobile Womb
	Theory) is based on the hypothesis that the fetus learns about 3
	dimensions (6 degrees of freedom) by being carried around in a
	Motile Womb (a moving mother) and through experience with being
	transported in vehicles, climbing stairs, moving in elevators. It
	suggests that movement is essential to the normal intellectual
	development of neonates, particularly with respect to 3d space. </i></font>

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The Mobile Womb Theory
	(MWT) is a hypothesis that suggests that the fetus learns about
	three dimensions (also known as the 6 degrees of freedom) through
	movement and experience with being transported in vehicles and other
	moving environments. The theory proposes that movement is important
	for the normal intellectual development of newborns, particularly in
	terms of their understanding of 3D space. It is based on the idea of
	the &quot;Motile Womb,&quot; or a mother who is constantly moving,
	as a way for the fetus to learn and develop. It is not clear what
	evidence or research supports this theory or how it has been tested
	or studied.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>It hasn't been tested
	and I'm not aware of research except that babies are born with some
	seemingly innate knowledge of physics. I am suggesting that this is
	because babies can feel inertia. There is a video on youtube of a
	baby standing up in the womb, and Gazelles can jump and run and
	Ibexes can descend a mountain on their first day. My thesis is that
	Human newborns have the cognitive capacity for this, but they no
	longer have the supporting &quot;matrix&quot; or scaffolding of a
	womb, so they can no longer lift their own weight and can't hold
	their head up very well, and that they have too much fat to do so
	without assistance.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It appears that the Mobile
	Womb Theory (MWT) is a hypothesis that has not been tested or
	supported by research. You mention that babies are born with some
	innate knowledge of physics, which may suggest that they are able to
	sense inertial forces. You also reference a video of a baby standing
	up in the womb and the ability of certain animals to perform
	physical feats on their first day of life as evidence for the MWT. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Your thesis is that human
	newborns have the cognitive capacity to perform these feats, but
	lack the physical support of the womb and have too much fat to do so
	without assistance. While this theory may be an interesting idea, it
	is important to note that it is not supported by scientific evidence
	and further research would be needed to determine its validity. It
	is always important to approach new ideas with a critical and
	open-minded perspective and to consider all available evidence
	before accepting or rejecting a theory.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>I think that the video
	of a fetus standing in the womb is proof that babies can stand if
	they still had a supportive matrix.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The video of a fetus
	standing in the womb may be an interesting and impressive sight, but
	it is not necessarily proof that babies are capable of standing if
	they still had a supportive matrix. It is important to approach this
	video and any other observations or claims with a critical and
	open-minded perspective, considering all available evidence and
	considering alternative explanations for what is observed.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">While the video may be
	consistent with the Mobile Womb Theory (MWT), it does not
	necessarily provide conclusive evidence for the theory or prove its
	validity. It is always important to carefully evaluate the evidence
	and consider all relevant factors before accepting or rejecting a
	theory.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Research shows that
	babies have a high fat ratio for most mammals, do you know any
	statistics on this?</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Babies of different
	species can have varying levels of fat, and the amount of fat that
	is considered normal or healthy for infants can also vary depending
	on factors such as the infant's age, growth rate, and overall
	health. In general, human infants tend to have a higher percentage
	of body fat compared to adults, with levels of body fat ranging from
	about 7-10% in the first month of life to about 15-20% at 6-12
	months of age.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">These levels of body fat
	are generally considered normal and necessary for proper growth and
	development, as fat provides a source of energy and helps to protect
	against cold temperatures and other environmental stresses. It is
	not uncommon for infants to have chubby cheeks and rolls of fat on
	their arms and legs, as this is a natural part of the infant's
	growth and development. However, it is important to monitor the
	overall health and growth of an infant and to seek medical advice if
	there are concerns about their body fat levels or overall health.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>I meant compared to
	other species, mice, apes, etc.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It is not uncommon for
	human infants to have higher levels of body fat compared to infants
	of other species, as body fat is important for proper growth and
	development in humans. However, the specific levels of body fat that
	are considered normal or healthy can vary depending on the species,
	as different animals have different physiological and nutritional
	requirements.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">For example, some species
	of primates, such as apes, may have lower levels of body fat
	compared to humans, as they are adapted to a more active lifestyle
	and may have higher energy needs. In contrast, some species of
	mammals, such as mice, may have higher levels of body fat compared
	to humans, as they have a higher metabolism and may require more fat
	as a source of energy.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It is important to note
	that these are generalizations, and the specific levels of body fat
	that are considered normal or healthy can vary within and among
	species depending on a variety of factors.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Summarize: Humans are
	among the fattest mammals at birth reflecting rapid fat deposition
	during the third trimester of pregnancy. For most mammals, roughly
	2-3% of birth weight is fat. Chimpanzee newborns average 3% of birth
	weight as body fat. The human level of newborn fatness exceeds that
	of all documented mammals other than a single seal species, which is
	born with a comparable level. Most human baby fat is subcutaneous
	white adipose tissue, rather than heat-producing brown fat.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>The evolutionary
	origins of the distinctive human pattern of fat deposition is not
	known, but several explanations have been suggested. Subcutaneous
	white fat is an insulator in some mammals; it was traditionally
	assumed that humans evolved extra baby fat to compensate for the
	loss of fur. The evolutionary importance of fat as a source of
	insulation in humans is debated, and there is minimal evidence that
	human baby fat evolved to serve this role.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>More recently it has
	been proposed that human baby fat evolved to protect brain
	energetics during starvation or nutritionally-stressful childhood
	infections. In humans, the unusually large brain consumes the
	majority of the body's energy at birth, and is rapidly damaged by a
	shortfall of energy or oxygen.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Human metabolism shows
	evidence for an evolved capacity to feed the brain on body fat
	during starvation, as evidenced for instance by the human brain's
	unusual ability to utilize fat-derived ketone bodies in lieu of
	glucose. Testing whether human baby fat evolved as an energetic
	buffer for the brain awaits data on brain size and body composition
	from a wider array of mammal and especially primate species.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Human infants are born
	with higher levels of body fat compared to infants of other species,
	with levels of body fat ranging from about 7-10% in the first month
	of life to about 15-20% at 6-12 months of age. This high level of
	body fat is considered normal and necessary for proper growth and
	development in humans, as it provides a source of energy and helps
	to protect against cold temperatures and other environmental
	stresses.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The evolutionary origins
	of this distinctive pattern of fat deposition in humans are not
	fully understood, but several explanations have been proposed. One
	theory is that human baby fat evolved to serve as an insulator,
	compensating for the loss of fur in humans. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Another theory is that
	human baby fat evolved to protect the brain's energy needs during
	times of starvation or nutritionally-stressful childhood infections.
	More research is needed to determine the evolutionary origins of
	human baby fat and its potential functions in the human body.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>My theory is that the
	additional fat allows the brain to have more fuel, and the brain is
	made mostly of fat, so the higher fat allows for the development of
	bigger brains, and is selected for by natural selection because it
	increases intelligence. Babies with higher fat levels had the
	capacity to be smarter, and they survived longer on their own. What
	about the fat ratio in newborn whales? Do you know any statistics on
	this?</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It is true that the human
	brain is largely made up of fat and that a high fat intake can
	provide the brain with more fuel. However, it is not clear that
	having a higher level of body fat in infants directly leads to
	increased intelligence or improved survival. While it is possible
	that a higher level of body fat could provide some benefits in terms
	of brain development or energy needs, it is important to note that
	there are many other factors that can influence intelligence and
	survival, including genetics, environment, and overall health.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">As for newborn whales, it
	is not uncommon for these animals to have relatively high levels of
	body fat, as they rely on this fat as a source of energy during
	their early development. For example, newborn humpback whales are
	born with a body fat content of around 25-30%, which helps to
	support their rapid growth and development. This high level of body
	fat is a natural part of the whale's development and is necessary
	for their survival. However, the specific levels of body fat that
	are considered normal or healthy for newborn whales can vary
	depending on the species and other factors.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>I meant that baby fat
	was selected for 100s of thousands of years ago or millions, because
	higher fat levels were correlated with higher chance of survival
	since &quot;fat starvation&quot; (protein starvation) clearly leads
	to lower intelligence levels.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>For example, consider
	the dangers of feeding a newborn rice milk or soy milk instead of
	breast milk. Research has shown that these babies have a higher
	likelihood of having intellectual disabilities.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It is true that proper
	nutrition, including sufficient fat intake, is important for the
	proper development and function of the brain and can influence
	intelligence and overall health. However, it is not clear that a
	higher level of body fat in infants directly leads to increased
	intelligence or improved survival. While it is possible that a
	higher level of body fat could provide some benefits in terms of
	brain development or energy needs, it is important to note that
	there are many other factors that can influence intelligence and
	survival, including genetics, environment, and overall health.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It is also important to
	note that the specific levels of body fat that are considered normal
	or healthy can vary depending on the individual and their overall
	health. In general, it is important for infants to receive proper
	nutrition, including sufficient fat intake, in order to support
	their growth and development.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">It is not recommended to
	feed infants rice milk or soy milk as a primary source of nutrition,
	as these milks do not provide the same nutrients as breast milk or
	formula that is specifically formulated for infants. It is
	recommended to speak with a healthcare provider for guidance on
	appropriate nutrition for infants.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>I am not talking about
	babies, I am talking about evolutionary development, as in
	selectionary pressures.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Summarize: In order for
	the brain to expand by nearly one third in under a million years, it
	must have required an environment that supported the increasing
	metabolic and nutritional demand to allow for such. By weight, the
	adult brain consumes more energy than any other organ. In fact, the
	adult brain accounts for only 2% of total body weight, yet consumes
	up to 23% of our daily energy requirements.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>This is even more
	pronounced in infants whereby the brain accounts for ~11% of total
	body weight but consumes ~74% of the daily energy requirements! How
	could we have supported this massive energy demand? What kind of
	environmental circumstances would allow for this?</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Hunting live animals
	would certainly explain how we were able to meet the high energy
	demands of a larger brain. However, this would mean we developed the
	skills and intelligence to successfully hunt before the brain
	expansion occurred. Thus, we have a paradox. Which brings us back to
	what came first: the ability to hunt or the larger brain?</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Based on this paper,
	the answer is the larger brain. Cunnane and Crawford suggest that
	whatever advantage was offered by having a larger brain was not
	necessary for survival, but was naturally selected for. But what
	environmental circumstances allowed us to metabolically afford a
	larger brain for natural selection to take hold of in the first
	place? And why was this unique to humans and not other primates?</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">This passage suggests that
	the expansion of the human brain over a relatively short period of
	evolutionary time may have been supported by an environment that
	provided the necessary energy and nutrition to support the increased
	metabolic demand of a larger brain.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The authors propose that
	this expansion may have been the result of natural selection, but
	they also raise the question of what environmental circumstances
	allowed humans to have the necessary energy and nutrition to support
	the development of a larger brain in the first place.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">They suggest that hunting
	may have provided the necessary energy, but that this ability would
	have had to have developed before the expansion of the brain
	occurred. This creates a paradox, as it is not clear which came
	first: the ability to hunt or the larger brain. The authors also
	note that this phenomenon is unique to humans and not seen in other
	primates.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>More fat, more meat,
	less plants A high quality diet containing more fat and meat and
	less plant material seemingly played a crucial role in the evolution
	of the human brain. This type of diet allowed for higher
	concentrations of nutrients and energy, since by weight, plant
	material supplies far less energy than animal products. The
	structure of our jaws and teeth, as well as the modern gut indicate
	humans were not designed for constant grinding, or the digestion and
	fermentation of large amounts of plant material, respectively.
	Rather, fossil records indicate that the human diet evolved to
	require less grinding compared to the diets of other primates.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>I think it’s fair to
	say it wasn’t a plant-based diet of low to moderate energy in the
	same environments as other primates that got us to the modern brain.
	Access to consistent, reliable, and nutritious foods would have been
	needed for the incremental changes in brain evolution Expansion of
	the brain would have required sustained and consistent changes in
	gene expression, random mutations are very unlikely to explain an
	increase in blood supply to the brain, due to its increase need for
	oxygen and nutrients.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>In addition to genes
	that promoted the storage of fat in fetuses, since fat is the energy
	and nutrient insurance as the brain develops. This would have
	required the mother to be receiving long-term sustainable nutrient
	and energy intake during pregnancy and lactation.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">This passage suggests that
	the evolution of the human brain may have been supported by a diet
	high in fat and meat and low in plant material, which provided
	higher concentrations of nutrients and energy. The structure of the
	human jaw, teeth, and gut indicate that humans were not well adapted
	to the digestion and fermentation of large amounts of plant
	material. Instead, the human diet evolved to require less grinding
	compared to other primates.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The authors suggest that
	access to consistent, reliable, and nutritious foods would have been
	necessary for the incremental changes in brain evolution. They also
	suggest that the expansion of the brain may have required sustained
	and consistent changes in gene expression, and that random mutations
	alone are unlikely to explain the increased blood supply and energy
	needs of the developing brain. The authors propose that this may
	have required the mother to receive sustained nutrient and energy
	intake during pregnancy and lactation.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Plants, animal
	carcasses, and hunting live animals would not have been sustainable
	enough to create this consistent change in gene expression that were
	controlling the architecture of the brain, a diet like this offers
	too much variability in nutrients and energy. Fruits and nuts can’t
	explain it either since these foods are seasonal. Therefore, a diet
	of solely these foods does not support the molecular and genetic
	requirements needed for brain expansion.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>So, we know the
	expansion of the brain required a lot of energy and nutrients and
	that these same high quality foods needed to be available over
	hundreds if not thousands of generations in order to continually
	express the genes needed for the process to occur. It doesn’t make
	sense that we would have continued to express these genes if the
	mother wasn’t consuming enough calories since the developing brain
	is highly influenced by maternal nutrition. Now that we’ve covered
	the environmental circumstances that likely didn’t contribute to
	the expansion of the human brain, let’s get to what Cunnane and
	Crawford believe did.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">According to Cunnane and
	Crawford, the evolution of the human brain was likely influenced by
	the availability of high quality, nutrient and energy-rich foods,
	such as fat and meat, which allowed for the expression of genes that
	promoted the development of a larger brain. These foods needed to be
	consistently available over a long period of time in order to
	sustain the changes in gene expression necessary for brain
	expansion.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The authors suggest that a
	diet of plants, animal carcasses, and hunting live animals may not
	have been sufficient to support this process, as they offer too much
	variability in nutrients and energy. Fruits and nuts, which are
	seasonal, may also not have been sufficient. The authors believe
	that the mother's nutritional intake during pregnancy and lactation
	played a crucial role in the development of the brain, as the
	developing brain is highly influenced by maternal nutrition.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>The Human Difference:
	Humans are characterized by having an unusually high percentage of
	subcutaneous fat as compared to visceral fat. This is especially
	apparent in newborns, roughly 15% fat at birth, compared to around
	3% in chimpanzee newborns. Few data have been published on newborn
	body composition in other species of non-human primates, but there
	is circumstantial and some quantitative evidence that primates are
	typically mammalian in this respect.</i></font></p>

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Mechanisms Responsible
	for the Difference: Late in the final trimester, human infants
	accumulate up to 500 grams of additional fat, accounting for around
	90% of total weight gain in the final weeks of gestation. A greater
	proportion of body fat in human newborns seems to reflect the
	lengthening of the gestational period in humans as compared to other
	apes, around 237 days in chimpanzees versus roughly 266 days in
	humans.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>This additional fat
	provides insulation for temperature regulation, as well as offering
	protection from nutritional stress. Infants born prematurely have

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">In summary, the passage

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The higher levels of fat
	in humans may be due to the lengthening of the gestational period
	and the protection it provides for premature infants. There are
	various hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of this
	distinctive human pattern of fat deposition, but the exact mechanism
	is not fully understood.</font></p>

	FATTEST: FAT BABIES WERE THE KEY TO EVOLUTION OF THE LARGE HUMAN
	BRAIN.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>In the past 2 million
	years, the hominid lineage leading to modern humans evolved
	significantly larger and more sophisticated brains than other
	primates. We propose that the modern human brain was a product of
	having first evolved fat babies. Hence, the fattest (infants)
	became, mentally, the fittest adults. Human babies have brains and
	body fat each contributing to 11-14% of body weight, a situation
	which appears to be unique amongst terrestrial animals.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Body fat in human
	babies provides three forms of insurance for brain development that
	are not available to other land-based species: (1) a large fuel
	store in the form of fatty acids in triglycerides; (2) the fatty
	acid precursors to ketone bodies which are key substrates for brain
	lipid synthesis; and (3) a store of long chain polyunsaturated fatty
	acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid, needed for normal brain
	development.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>The triple combination
	of high fuel demands, inability to import cholesterol or saturated
	fatty acids, and dependence on docosahexaenoic acid puts the
	mammalian brain in a uniquely difficult situation compared with
	other organs and makes its expansion in early humans all the more
	remarkable. We believe that fresh- and salt-water shorelines
	provided a uniquely rich, abundant and accessible food supply, and
	the only viable environment for evolving both body fat and larger
	brains in human infants.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The article suggests that
	the evolution of larger brains in humans may have been made possible
	by the evolution of fat babies, as the fat stores in human infants
	provide fuel, precursors for brain lipid synthesis, and long chain
	polyunsaturated fatty acids necessary for normal brain development.
	The article also posits that the availability of a rich and
	accessible food supply, particularly at shorelines, may have allowed
	for the evolution of both body fat and larger brains in human
	infants.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Summarize: Fatter
	Babies Have Bigger Heads In their study (Stephen C Cunnane, Michael
	A Crawford), published in the current issue of the American Journal
	of Human Biology, researchers studied 1,069 human newborns. They
	found that the fatter the baby was, the bigger his or her head was
	likely to be, even after accounting for other factors such as
	gestational age and birth length. They say the finding shows that
	newborns need that extra fat to feed their brains during the
	critical early stages of development. </i></font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Previous studies have
	shown that the brain needs high amounts of energy in order to
	function and grow, and the bigger the organ is, the more energy it
	needs. Researchers say this is especially true during infancy when
	the brain goes through its maximum growth stage. For example, a
	newborn's brain can expend as much as 60% of the total energy
	produced by the body. Because human babies are not capable of
	fending for themselves, fatness as a newborn may have developed as
	an evolutionary mechanism to protect the brain as it develops.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Malnutrition in early
	life can negatively affect the brain's development and is a major
	cause of infant death. Researchers say prior studies have also shown
	that birth weight and head size at birth are associated with head
	size and mental abilities in childhood and later life. Therefore,
	newborn fatness would have been favored by natural selection and
	explain why the trait has endured throughout human evolution.</i></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">To summarize, the research
	suggests that newborn human babies have a higher percentage of body
	fat compared to other primates, and this fat may have evolved as a
	protective mechanism for the brain during the critical early stages
	of development. The study found that the fatter a newborn was, the
	larger their head was, which may be due to the high energy
	requirements of the developing brain. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Previous research has also
	shown that birth weight and head size at birth are linked to head
	size and cognitive abilities later in life, suggesting that newborn
	fatness may have been favored by natural selection and has persisted
	in human evolution. This may be due to the need for protection
	against malnutrition, which can negatively affect brain development
	and cause infant death.</font></p>

	babies might have contributed to larger head size, brain size,

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Fatter babies might have
	contributed to larger head size, brain size, intelligence, and
	increased myelination over evolutionary time because fat is an
	important source of energy and nutrients for the developing brain.
	The brain requires a high amount of energy in order to function and
	grow, and the bigger the brain is, the more energy it needs. During
	infancy, the brain goes through its maximum growth stage and can
	expend up to 60% of the total energy produced by the body.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">In humans, newborns have a
	relatively high percentage of body fat compared to other primates,
	which provides them with an energy reserve that can be used to fuel
	brain development. The fat stored in the body of a newborn provides
	three forms of insurance for brain development: (1) a large fuel
	store in the form of fatty acids in triglycerides; (2) the fatty
	acid precursors to ketone bodies, which are key substrates for brain
	lipid synthesis; and (3) a store of long chain polyunsaturated fatty
	acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid, which is needed for normal

	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Researchers suggest that
	access to a high quality diet that was rich in fats and nutrients
	allowed for the evolution of fat babies and larger brains in human
	infants. This would have provided the necessary energy and nutrients
	for the brain to grow and develop, leading to increased head size,
	brain size, and intelligence over evolutionary time.</font></p>

	The brain has a high energy demand and requires a constant supply of
	nutrients in order to grow and function properly.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Fat is an important source
	of energy for the brain, as it can be broken down into fatty acids
	and used as a fuel source. In addition, fat is also a good source of
	essential fatty acids, such as omega-3s and omega-6s, which are
	necessary for brain development.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Increased myelination, the
	process by which the nervous system is insulated with a protective
	layer of fat called myelin, is also essential for proper brain
	function. Myelin allows for the efficient transmission of nerve
	impulses and is important for learning and memory.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">There is evidence to
	suggest that higher fat levels in newborns may be associated with
	larger head size and brain size. For example, a study published in
	the American Journal of Human Biology found that fatter newborns had
	larger head sizes, even after accounting for other factors such as
